### About Me

My name is Curtis Free, and I have [the most wonderful wife in the anywhere](http://curtisandrebecca.com).

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu),
with "threads" _Platforms_ and _Information Internetworks_. I am currently working toward an M.S.
in the same field, with a specialization in Information Security.

-----

My primary interests lie in computing – especially lower-level and back-end topics. My favorite
areas of study include web development, databases, operating systems, computer architecture, and
(more specifically) Linux. 

-----

Around the Internet, I sometimes use the alias **ssjlegendx** (a name that has stuck around since
my _DragonBall Z_ days).

### About CurtisFree.com

_CurtisFree.com_ -- as you might have supposed -- is my little part of the Web.

The avatar seen on this site (and that I use in many places) was created with an online avatar
generator like [the one found on I Am Bored](http://www.i-am-bored.com/bored_link.cfm?link_id=9962).

The simple design of this website – which has "evolved" slightly over time – was originally based
on [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/)'s "Generator" theme.

The color scheme (particularly the green background) is inspired by that of [claimID](https://claimid.com/)
(and possibly other websites).

Navigation menu icons are part of the free and excellent "Silk" icon set from
[famfamfam.com](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/).
