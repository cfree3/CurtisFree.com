My name is Curtis Free, and I have [the most wonderful wife in the anywhere][curtisandrebecca]
and [a perfect kid][matthewdrakefree].

My pronouns are _he_/_him_/_his_.

I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the [Georgia Institute of
Technology][gatech]. Through Georgia Tech's ["Threads" program][threads], my undergraduate focus
areas were _Platforms_ and _Information Internetworks_. As a graduate student, I specialized in
Information Security.

As my studies suggest, I am very interested in information security, computer architectures,
operating systems, networking, and the web. Professionally, I tie all of these interests together
and have a particular focus on secure database designs. From a "hobbyist" perspective, I follow
the world of mobile technology somewhat closely and am very interested in security on mobile
platforms.

Around the internet, I might be found using the alias **ssjlegendx** (a name with roots in my
_DragonBall Z_ days). More recently, I've preferred to use some variation on my actual name.

The simple design of this website was originally based on [LiveJournal][livejournal]'s
"Generator" theme. The color scheme (particularly the green background) is inspired by that of
sites such as [claimID][claimid].
