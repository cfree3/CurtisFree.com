### About Me

My name is Curtis Free, and I have [the most wonderful wife in the anywhere][curtisandrebecca].

I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the [Georgia Institute of Technology][gatech].
Through Georgia Tech's ["Threads" program][threads], my undergraduate focus areas were _Platforms_
and _Information Internetworks_. As a graduate student, I specialized in Information Security.

My primary interest areas are web development, databases, operating systems, and computer
architecture.

Around the Internet, I sometimes use the alias **ssjlegendx** (a name with roots in my _DragonBall
Z_ days but that I've continued to use).

### About CurtisFree.com

_CurtisFree.com_ is my little part of the Web.

The simple design of this website was originally based on [LiveJournal][livejournal]'s "Generator"
theme. The color scheme (particularly the green background) is inspired by that of
[claimID][claimid] (and possibly other websites).

Fonts are from [Google Web Fonts][fonts]. The site favicon, a miniature version of an avatar I use
around the web, was created with an online avatar generator like [the one found on I Am
Bored][avatar_generator].
